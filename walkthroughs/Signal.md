## Insecure Communications on your Phone

Depending on the manufacturer of your phone and its OS, the level of security
provided in text or voice conversation varies.

For example, Alice has an iPhone and sends a text to Bob's iPhone.

* When Alice's phone is locked, her "sent" text is locked.
* When Bob's phone is locked, her "received" text is locked.
* iPhones encrypt text in flight between themselves
* Bob has text messages sent to his iCloud account. _What's the encryption status here? Are these texts subpoenable?_

Or consider: Alice has an iPhone but Charlie has an Android device:

* When Alice's phone is locked, her "sent" text is locked.
* Bob's phone _might_ encrypt his received message
* The text between platforms is _not_ encrypted

It's hard to know what the protection status is for your text messages.

## How they spy on you

Depending on the devices or platforms in use, hackers or governments can
"listen in" on the unencrypted transmission _or_ gain access to your
unencrypted messages by gaining custody of your phone.

## How you protect yourself

In order to smooth these differences, you can use Signal an application that
keeps both your text content _and_ voice content encrypted end-to-end,
regardless of application.
