## Your actions at risk

When you visit a web page in a standard browser a log is kept which associates
your IP address (your computer's home on the internet) and the web resource
you requested.

If you send a search engine a request for "refugee resources in Elbonia," it is
possible for a monitor to see that a computer at your addressed was looking
into these resources. Whether you were  writing a fictional novel about
refugees in Elbonia or planning your own flight is _frankly_ no one's business
but your own.

## How they spy on you

By analyzing web server logs, monitoring your activity on public Wi-Fi, your
privacy is undermined.

## How you protect yourself

Download and use Tor Browser.

### Using Tor

Open Tor Browser instead of Firefox, Chrome, or Safari. Tor Browser routes your
request through the Tor network which will take your request, slice it up, and
make the record, from the server side, that multiple, disparate sources
requested the web resource. Only your Tor browser session knows that those
requests were stitched together to provide you a single web page.

### The Nitty Gritty

Visit Tor Project and [download the browser](https://www.torproject.org/). You
needn't use it all the time, of course. But when you want to increase your
anonymity versus network-based spies, use it.
