## How they spy on you

Owners of the network you communicate on are able to see, modify and flat out deny any kind of message that
travels across their network. This includes giving others access to your messages. 

## How you protect yourself

If you encrypt the text itself, without relying on services to do it for you, you have the most flexability
when communicating over text. You can take that encrypted text and send over any medium. Only the person who
it's intended for can decrypt and read the message. Keybase is a site that uses the tried-and-true yet
difficult to understand, GPG. You'll soon be able to send GPG encrypted messages to other's without having to
know the intricacies of GPG. 

### Using Keybase.io

1. Create an account on Keybase

### The Nitty Gritty

Keybase solves two problems with GPG. 
  1. The CLI interface is a little obtuse and allows users to make mistakes that leave them unprotected
  2. GPG relies on a certain degree of trust. Normally, you meet the person you want to want to communicate
     with and exchange public keys. Simply relying on someone's word that this is the PubKey is a recipe for
     getting you messages intercepted. Keybase makes users associate social accounts to their PubKey so when
     you visit their Keybase page, you can see that this keybase account also owns several other public
     facing internet account. If I want a PubKey to send a journalist some information, I can go to their
     Keybase account and see that thier PubKey is also associated with a webiste and twitter account that I
     know belong to the journalist. This allows me a greater sense of confidence that I'm encypting a message
     using the correct persons PubKey.
